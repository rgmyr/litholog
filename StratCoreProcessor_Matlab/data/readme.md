This folder contains data files that were created using the `StratCoreProcessor` digitizer. 

To browse this data, run the digitizer, and then first load the image, and then load the .mat file. You can then see the data used to represent the graphic log digitally. 

The `demo_data.mat` file is all of the graphic logs used in the demo collated into a single file that can be loaded into Matlab for analysis. In the main `litholog` folder, the `demo_data.csv` was created using this .mat file and the `StratCoreProcessor` utilities.
